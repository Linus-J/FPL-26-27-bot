"""One bench-weight derivation per decision, shared by every consumer (B3c).

B3 derived the weights INSIDE `optimise_squad`, which cannot work on an
ordinary week: `agent/decision_engine.py` never calls `optimise_squad` there,
it calls `evaluate_transfers`, and a transfer ILP has no squad solve to derive
from. So the squad build priced slot 1 at the derived value while the weekly
planner priced it at the static 0.53 — the buys-a-substitute-the-planner-
sells-back divergence `optimiser/transfers.py:417-431` exists to prevent.

Two shapes replace it:

* ordinary weekly path — hoist once, from the INCUMBENT XI, ahead of every
  consumer;
* rebuild paths (free hit, wildcard, cold start) — solve, derive from that
  solution's XI, re-solve ONCE. No loop, so it cannot oscillate.

Measured on the live GW4 frame, the two answers differ by 0.058 / 0.049 /
0.017 on the slots and 0.102 on the keeper, and the difference is systematic
rather than noise: `optimise_squad` selects nailed-on players, so a solved XI's
mean P(start) is always the higher of the two. They are different questions,
not one question with an error bar.
