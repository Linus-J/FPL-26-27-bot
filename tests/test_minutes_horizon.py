"""A8 — per-gameweek minutes bands across the projection horizon.

Real defect: ``predict_minutes_bands`` collapsed its feature frame with
``groupby("player_id").last()`` and returned ``dict[player_id -> bands]``.
``assemble_gw_projections`` called it ONCE, outside the ``for gw in target_gws``
loop, and then read the same scalar on every iteration — so a player's
``start_probability`` was byte-identical across the whole horizon. Measured on
the live database before this change: 0 of 615 players showed any variation
across GW4-GW8.

That made the A6 congestion features unreachable in the one place they were
built for. A post-international break at GW6 gives every club 14 days' rest;
a Champions League tie the Tuesday before GW7 takes three days off it. Neither
could move a projection that was decided once, at GW3's fixture.
