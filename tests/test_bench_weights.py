"""Bench slot weights derived from the XI actually chosen (2026-09-06).

The shipped constants (0.53, 0.15, 0.03) were computed once from a GW1 XI
whose mean start probability was 0.93 and never recomputed. An XI carrying
several 0.78s needs a materially fatter slot 1; the live squad bought three
bench players at P(start) <= 0.03 partly because slot 3 is worth 0.03."""
